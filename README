Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


For Atri:
=============

On the desktop machine, there are 2 separate Linux distributions. One of the logs into Ubuntu Desktop, and the other one to
Ubuntu Server for testing. Ubuntu Desktop has kernel version 5.3.0 if you need to differentiate them somehow in GRUB.

The location of the project is: ~/Projects/Linux.
The password for Ubuntu Desktop is: smrtfasizmuslobodanarodu (death to fascism - freedom to the people)

In ~/Projects/Linux you have several scripts (copy_*) which extract the appropriate *.tar archives to the HDD. copy_current.sh
extracts the current kernel tar archive from the linux subdirectory. The tar archive can be built using (sudo) make -j8 tar-pkg.
The configuration is edited using: make menuconfig.

After building the kernel and running the script (extract the kernel, strip the modules of symbols, restart) boot
Ubuntu Server - kernel version 4 (not 5.4.0-rc3). Log in and update GRUB, initramfs and reboot. Then you can boot into the
new kernel.

To boot into the test environment, boot into 5.4.0-rc3+.
That gives you access to Ubuntu Server:
username: utesic
password: testmachine

The test environment boots from the HDD which is connected to the USB3 port.
